<p>If you have lego this is a great one. You make a lego model using household objects and other toys, like hot wheels going through your model like they are the lego people’s car, or dolls living in a lego house. You could have real-world objects as well, for example a dice as a stool (coincidence: 1 dice = 2 studs), or try decorating something with lego to make it more interesting.</p>
