    <h1> Make your own board game</h1>
    <p>
        Requires:Paper, pencil/pen<br />

        1. Start with a piece of butcher paper if you have it, or if you don’t, several sheets of A4 paper
        taped together ON THE BACK. Do not tape the sheets together on the front or you will not be able 
        to draw on them partly.<br />
        2. The first thing to do is draw a board. Draw a square labelled ‘start’, then a square labelled ‘finish’
        away from that.<br />

    <p>
        3. After that, draw a long path between the two squares, trying to use all of the board.<br />

    <p>
        4. Then, divide the path up into squares.<br />

    <p>
        5. After that, label some of the squares with one symbol, anything you want, and an equal amount 
        with another symbol. These will be the squares which let you pick a card. One will be good cards 
        and the other will be bad cards. Randomly space them. Here B is bad and G is good.<br />

    <p>
        6. Add portals. Portals can send you forward, bring you back, or go both ways. When drawn, show that
        they are linked by drawing a line between them. Use arrows to indicate the direction. Make 
        sure to think carefully about the position of your portals and whether they will make the game
        too easy or too hard.<br />

    <p>
        7. OK, that’s your board done! Now you need a couple more touches. First, get two sheets of coloured
        paper and divide them up into equal rectangles. These will be your cards.<br />

    <p>
        8. Now label your cards. Generally, the good cards are the opposite of the bad ones, and the more
        powerful a card, the rarer. Do whatever you want based on these rules. 
        You can also add challenges which give boosts if completed, such as dancing for a minute or 
        playing paper-scissors-rock with your opponents.<br />

        9. The final step is to customise the game. Will it be the forces of good and darkness racing to the
        Diamond of power, or a cow race? This includes the pieces, which can be anything that can fit
        in the squares. Similarly, the cards could be magical loot or food, and the portals could be 
        teleporters or speed boosts. Note: the cards and portals are not necessary, but we recommend at
        least one to make the game interesting.<br />

        How to play
    </h2>

    <p>
        1. Shuffle the cards and deal into piles. Choose the order of players in any way you like. <br />
        2. When you roll, go forward that number of spaces.<br />
        3. If you land on a card square, pick up the relevant card and follow the instructions. Then put
        the card at the bottom of the deck.<br />
        4. If you land on a portal, check which way you should go.<br />
        5. If you land on a square with another player, that player misses their next turn.<br />
        6. First to the finish wins.<br />
