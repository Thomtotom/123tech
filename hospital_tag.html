        <h1>Hospital Tag</h1>
        <h2>4 or more people</h2>
        <p>Everyone is in. If you are tagged, you lose an arm and can't tag with it. If you are tagged again, you lose the other arm and can't tag at all. The next time, you lose one leg and must hop, and the time after that, you must roll around like a worm. Have someone call out "hospital" occasionally, and everyone who is a worm goes back to being a human.</p>
