    <h1>Farmer Farmer </h1>
    <h2>5 or more people</h2>
    <p>
        1. Choose two boundaries that the players have to run across, and two that they can't go outside.<br />
        2. Choose someone to be in.<br />
        3. Everyone who is not in calls out "Farmer, Farmer, may we cross your golden river?" The person who is in calls a certain aspect, for example "only if you're wearing green!" Everyone who has that aspect is safe, and everyone else can be tagged.<br />
        4. If you are tagged, you are a tagger.<br />
        5. Once everyone is tagged, the game is over. Alternatively, the last person not tagged can be in for the next round.
