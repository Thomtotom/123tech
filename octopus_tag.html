            1. Choose two boundaries that the players have to run across, and two that they can't go outside.<br />
            2. Choose someone to be in. They are the "Octopus". <br />
            3. The person who is in calls someone to run across. As soon as they make it to the other line or get tagged, the tagger shouts "Octopus" and everyone else runs across.<br />
            4. If you are tagged, you must stand in one place. You are now a "Seaweed".You can reach out and tag people, and turn around once everyone is on the other side<br />
            5. Once everyone is tagged, the game is over. Alternatively, the last person not tagged can be in for the next round.
