    <h1>Learn to play last card</h1>
    <p>
        1. Deal each player 7 cards. <br />
        <br />
        2. Flip the top card of the deck over. This will be the discard pile.<br />
        <br />
        3. Players decide who will go first.<br />
        <br />
        4. On your turn, you can play down a card, as long as the card below it is the same suit or rank.<br />
        <br />
        5. Instead, you can play down multiple cards of the same rank, as long as the bottom of the cards 
        you play down can be played onto the card below it. <br />
        <br />
        6. If you can't play anything, you must pick up a card from the deck.<br />
        <br />
        7. Some cards have special powers. If you play down a 5, the next player must pick up 5. If 
        they can play down a  5 as well, that 5 is added to the total, and the next player has to pick
        10. If they can play a 5, the next player has to pick up 15, and if they can play a 5, the next 
        has to pick up 20. The same thing happens with 2s, but only picking up 2 per 2 played. 10 makes 
        the next player miss a turn,  and an ace changes the suit to your choice. You can add other rules 
        cards, but these are the fundamental ones.<br />
        <br />
        8. If you have only one card in your hand, or a set of cards of the same rank, you MUST say "last card".
        If you do not say "last card", you must pick up four cards. It does not matter whether these are playable.
        If you play your last card, you have won.<br />
        <br />
        9. If the draw pile is out of cards, take the top card of the discard pile and put it to the side as the
        new discard pile, then flip the discard pile over and use it as the draw pile. Repeat until someone wins.
