        <h1>Ultimate Tag</h1>
        <h2>4 or more people</h2>
        <p>Everyone is a tagger. If you tag someone, they sit down and wait for you to be tagged. when this happens, they are not tagged anymore. If two people tag each other at the same time, they play paper-scissors-rock and the loser is out until the other person is tagged. You cannot tag someone while they are playing paper-scissors-rock.</p>
