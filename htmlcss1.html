    <h4>
        <br>Html css basics:


        To code of corse you need a editor, we recommend something like <a href="https://trinket.io/login">Trinket</a> or <a href="https://repl.it/">repl.it</a> we suggest trinket because you can easily navigate it. Trinket and repl.it is free to log in and there are no ¨premium¨ that you need to pay for either. Once you log into repl.it or trinket look around on the front page and somewhere you will see a ¨new repl.it¨ or ¨new trinket¨, in repl when you click new repl there is a input bar type html under the input bar something like html5 will show up click it and wait for it to load. When you click into the new trinket you will see a loug list of names these are coding language names but we only want html5.
        <br>
        <br>
        When you have got a coding doc open type in this:
        <br>
        &lt;html><br>
        &lt;head><br>

        &lt;head><br>
        &lt;body><br>
        &lt;h1>this is a random blurb (remember to put this inside the two body tags)&lt;/h1><br>
        &lt;/body><br>
        &lt;/html><br>
        <br>
        note: it will only work if the / is there at the last tag.
        <br>
        &lt;body>,&lt;head> and &lt;html> are all wide span tags meaning they basically have the code in the you will be writing most of your stuff  in the &lt;body> tag. H1, body, head, html are html tags there are many tags, H1 is a text tag if you click run or you have auto run you should see the text you typed in between the two &lt;h1> &lt;/H1> tags. H1 stands for heading one there are six headings one paragraph and a break, here is a list:

        <br>
        &lt;h1> - &lt;h6> = heading   size 1 - 6<br>
        &lt;p> = paragraph tag<br>
        &lt;br> = breaks a line <br>
        <br>
        CSS
        With this  knowledge you now know how to write a small story in html. But how do you style it?, does it look nice? Well did you know they have a whole different language to style to access this language just in the html doc we need to create a style tag: &lt;style>&lt;/style> in the style tag you are able to write a front end code called css. The first thing we are going to do is style the body we write it like this
        &lt;style><br>


        Body{<br>

        }<br>

        &lt;/style>
        <br>
        Now inside the body{} we are going to write this.<br>
        <br>
        &lt;style>

        Body{
        Background-color: blue;
        }
        &lt;/style>
        <br>
        Note: you can replace blue with any color you want
        <br>
        <br>
        With this you can style a lot of things but this is going to be it for this lesson now we will go back to html and look at div align you probably would have guessed what this is for (to align stuff if you did not realize) we use it like this



        &lt;html>
        &lt;head>
        &lt;style>
        Body{
        Background-color: blue;
        }
        &lt;/style>

        &lt;/head>
        &lt;body>
        &lt;div align = ¨center¨>
        &lt;h1>this is a random blurb (remember to put this inside the two body tags)&lt;/h1>
        &lt;/div>
        &lt;/body>
        &lt;/html>

        Note: you may change the center inside the div tag to: right left up down.
        As you can see this is a div tag, div tags can be used for lots of things this is maybe the most common. This is our last step for this lesson here a link to the next: <a href="htmlcss2.html">lesson2</a> good bye!
        <p>Also try our <a href="codeeditor.html">Code editor</a>, which lets you code. It does have some special rules, and these only apply to this editor. </p>
        <button class="button button"><a href="digifun.html"><span>Back</span></a></button>
