            <h1>Freeze frame!</h1>
            <h3>Freeze frame is a game of telling a story through a frozen scene.</h3>
            <h2>You need</h2>
            <p>5 or more people</p>
            <h2>How to play</h2>

            <p>Decide who will be the scene master. The scene master gets to choose a well-known movie, book etc but doesn't tell anyone yet. Now choose a couple people who will do the freeze frame. You want preferably 2+ people doing the freeze frame and 2+ people who will guess what the scene is. The scene master tells the group who will be doing the freeze frame what the book or movie is, and the group has to discuss how they will portray at as best as possible while staying still and silent. The person who can guess what the scene is first becomes the scene master. You could have a set list of scenes that both teams know. </p>

            <h3>Extra</h3>
            <p>If you want a little more to the game you can gently tap the people doing the scene on the head, and they will say a line or a clue ( slightly like a hint)</p>
