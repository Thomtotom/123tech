Show answer If all the animals stood on two legs, there would be 29 x 2 = 58 legs on the ground. That means there must be 92 - 58 = 34 legs in the air, which means there must be 34 ÷ 2 = 17 tigers and 29 - 17 = 12 ostriches.  Imelda is moving house and has packed up her wardrobe. She has blue, green, black and brown shoes, with 1 pair of blue, 2 of green, 4 of black and 5 of brown. She’s unpacking her wardrobe in a power cut at night. How many shoes must she unpack until she has a pair?  Show answer The worst-case scenario is that she takes one of each color. Then, a fifth shoe must match one of them, therefore 5 is the amount she will need to unpack.  Gerald has 31 socks in his draw, 11 identical blue 8 identical red and 12 identical black. The lights have fused and he is completely in the dark. How many socks should he take out before he can be sure he has one of each color?  Show answer The worst case scenario is that he will draw all but the red ones, then a 24th sock must be red and give him one of each color.  Of 2000 students at University of Sunware 55% are boys. Of those 40%are studying science subjects; of those 75% are first years; of those 60% have fair hair, and one-third of those regularly attend lectures. How many boys regularly attend lectures?  Show answer Multiply all given percentages to get 66.  Mr Spud is drawing up plans for a new rectangular vegetable plot. He’s planning to border the plot with wooden planks that are exactly 1 meter in length. If he does not want a square plot, what is the smallest number of planks that he would need if numerically he wants to make a number also equal to the area?  Show answer Each square meter on the edge of the plot will have exactly one plank. Each corner will have one extra plank, so to make the perimeter equal to the area there must be exactly 4 square meters with no boundaries. The four squares can only be arranged in two ways, in a 2x2 square, which leads to a square with perimeter and area 16, or a 1x4 rectangle which leads to a rectangle with perimeter and area 18. The first is a square, but the second is a rectangle. The solution is 18.  Using only a 7-minute hourglass and a 11-minute hourglass, time 15 minutes exactly. Bonus: time it with the time starting the first time you flip either of the hourglasses. Show answer Solution: Flip both at the same time. When the 7-minute runs out, the 15 minutes start. When the 11-minute runs out, flip it. When it runs out again, that is the end of the 15 minutes. Bonus: Flip both to start, but once the 7-minute is empty, flip it again. 4 minutes later, the 11-minute will empty, then flip the 7-minute again. When it has ran out, the 15 minutes is over.  Mr Smith, who owns a pharmacy, orders 10 100g bottles of pills, each with 1000 pills. He receives a message saying that one bottle of pills has the pills 0.11g instead of 0.1grams. He knows the weight of a normal pill. He has a digital scale. How can he figure out which one is wrong?  Show answer Solution: Take 1 pill from the first bottle, 2 from the second, etc. Weigh all of them, and if the total is 0.01gs too heavy, it must be from the first bottle, iif 0.02, from the second, etc.  a. You are in a race. You overtake the person in second place. What place are you now in?  b. You are in a race. You overtake the person in last place. What place are you now in?  Show answer a. Second place. b. You cannot overtake the person in last place because you would have to be behind them, and then they wouldn’t have been last in the first place.  Penny and Bob are playing a game. There are 100 coins lined up in a row, and they can only take one of the coins on the end of the row on their turn. The winner is the person who collects the most money. Penny starts. Who will win?  Show answer Penny. Number the coins 1 to 100. When Penny takes the first coin, she will leave Bob with either both even-numbered or all odd-numbered coins on the ends. Whichever happens, Bob must take one of these, leaving one of each for Penny. Penny can get all the odd-numbered coins or all the even-numbered coins. All she has to do is figure out which is greater, and make her first coin one of them.  You have 15 plastic bags. Arrange the smallest possible number of sweets so that each bag has a different number of sweets. Each bag must have at least one sweet.  Show answer Put one sweet in one bag, then put one sweet and that bag inside another bag, and so on. You need one sweet per bag, or 15.

A number divisible by an even number must end in an even digit, so b d f h must be even, which forces a c g i to be odd .abcd must be divisible by 4, so cd must be divisible by 4. Sincec is odd, d must be 2 or 6. abc and abcdef are both divisible by 3, so def must be divisible by 3. This means there are only two possibilities for def: 258 and 654. Option 1: def is 258 8gh must be divisible by 8. If h is 4, there is no odd number possible, so h must be 6. That leaves b as 4. Our number looks like this: a4c258g6i0. g+6+i must be divisible by 3, since abcdef and abcdefghi are, so g+i must be. By elimination, you will find that only 3 and 9 can beg and i. There are four possibilities for acgi: 1739, which means 1472583690 7139, which means 7412583690 1793, which means 1472589630 7193, which means 7412589630 None of these work. 1472583690 fails because 14725836 is not divisible by 8 7412583690 fails because 7412583 is not divisible by 7 1472589630 fails because 1472589 is not divisible by 7 7412589630 fails because 7412589 is not divisible by 7.  Option two: def is 654. 4gh must be divisible by 8, so 400+ghmust be divisible by 8, so gh must be divisible by 8. g is odd, and h is 2 or 8. h cannot be 8 because gh cannot be divisible by 8, so h must be 2. abcdefghi and abcdef are divisible by 3, so g2i must be divisible by 3. g and i must be one of these: 1 and 3 3 and 1 1 and 9 9 and 1 3 and 7 7 and 3 7 and 9 9 and 7 Test the options: 1 and 3: 7896541230 fails because 7896541 is not divisible by 7 9876541230 fails because 9876541 is not divisible by 7 3 and 1: 7896543210 fails because 7896543 is not divisible by 7 9876543210 fails because 9876543 is not divisible by 7 1 and 9: 7836541290 fails because 7836541 is not divisible by 7 3876541290 fails because 3876541 is not divisible by 7 9 and 1: 7836541290 fails because 78365412 is not divisible by 8 3876549210 fails because 3876549 is not divisible by 7 3 and 7: 1896543270 fails because 1896543 is not divisible by 7 9816543270 fails because 9816543 is not divisible by 7 7 and 3 1896547320 fails because 1896547 is not divisible by 7 9816547320 fails because 9816547 is not divisible by 7 7 and 9: 1836547290 fails because 1836547 is not divisible by 7 3816547290 This works! 9 and 7: 1836549270 fails because 1836549 is not divisible by 7 3816549270 fails because 3816549 is not divisible by 7  Finally, the answer is 3816547290.  8809 = 6 2513 = 0 9876 = 4 1239 = 1 9999 = 4 1777 = 0 9222 = 1 8877 = 4 0123 = 1 0000 = 4 1111 = 0 6712 = 1 3653 = 1 8096 = 5 2138 = 2 2222 = 0 8035 = 3 What is 2581?  Show answer Each hole in a number counts as 1, so 2581 = 2  Exactly 1 of these is correct: 44^2+77^2=4477 55^2+66^2=5566 66^2+55^2=6655 99^2+22^2=9922 88^2+33^2=8833 Which one?  Show answer 44^2 must end in 6, and 77^2 must end in 9. Their sum must end in 5, so the first is untrue. 66^2 and 55^2 end in 6 and 5, so their sum will end in 1. 99^2 and 22^2 end in 1 and 4, so their sum will end in 5. But 88^2 and 33^2 end in 4 and 9, which sums to 3. This is the only one that can be true and it is: 88^2 + 33^2 = 8833.  How many 0s are at the end of 100 factorial?  Show answer What it means to have a certain number of zeroes at the end of a number is to have it divisible by 10 that many times. 10 is 2 x 5, so for each zero there must be a 2 and a 5. It is obvious that a 2 occurs many more times than 5, so we can count the fives. 5, 10 ,15,...95, 100. All 20 divide by 5 once, except for 25, 50, 75, and 100, which divide twice. So the answer is 24. For the record, 100!=93,326,215,443,944,152,681,699,238,856,266,700,490,715,968,264,381,621,468,592,963,895,217,599,993,229,915,608,941,463,976,156,518,286,253,697,920,827,223,758,251,185,210,916,864,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.

Part 1: Original series (books 1-5)       At the start of book 1 of this series, the world is in war, and five dragonets must figure out how to end it. Along the way, they all discover who they really are.        Part 2: Jade Mountain (books 6-10)       After the war ended, the five dragonets started a school in which dragonets of different tribes. But an evil dragon is rising, and a young dragonet may have had the first real prophecy in centuries….       Part 3: The lost continent (books 11-13+)       On the other side of the dragon’s planet, there is another continent, with different types of dragons.

The first trilogy is kind of the origin story for the second story arc but at the same time something completely new as in  story wise. It is definity recommended that you read these in order or else it does not make sense. The second story arc is very fun to read. It ticks all of my boxe’s: has a villain, a kind of dream team and a power that seems untouchable. The third and probably finill arc has a very unexpected twist where the story instead of  taking place in the original world takes place in a completely different setting. I myself loved this part.        <br><br>       Prophecy of arc one:       When the war has lasted twenty years...       the dragonets will come.       When the land is soaked in blood and tears...       the dragonets will come.       <br><br>       Find the SeaWing egg of deepest blue.       Wings of night shall come to you.       The largest egg in mountain high       will give to you the wings of sky.       For wings of earth, search through the mud       for an egg the color of dragon blood.       And hidden alone from the rival queens,       the SandWing egg awaits unseen.              Of three queens who blister and blaze and burn,       two shall die and one shall learn       if she bows to a fate that is stronger and higher,       she'll have the power of wings of fire.       <br>       <br>       Five eggs to hatch on brightest night,       five dragons born to end the fight.       Darkness will rise to bring the light.       The dragonets are coming...       <br><br>              <br><br>              Book one wings of fire dragonet prophecy:       Blurb:clay has lived his whole life under the mountain. The Mudwing dragonet knows that war is raging between the dragon tribes in the world outside - a war that he and four other dragonets are destined to end, according to the mysterious prophecy they’ve been taught. The five “chosen” dragonets were stolen from their homes while they were still in there eggs - and hidden away for years - all to fulfill the prophecy.       <br>       But not every dragonet wants a destiny. And when danger threatens one of their own, Clay and his friends may choose freedom over fate …. Leave the mountain …. And set the dragon world on course that no one could have predicted.       <br>       <br>       <br>       Book two wings of fire the lost heir:        <br>       blurb:       <br>       She can't believe it's finally happening. Tsunami and her fellow dragonets of destiny are journeying under the water to the great SeaWing Kingdom. Stolen as an egg from the royal hatchery, Tsunami is eager to meet her future subjects and reunite with her mother, Queen Coral.       <br>       But Tsunami's triumphant return doesn't go quite the way she imagined. Queen Coral welcomes her with open wings, but a mysterious assassin has been killing off the queen's heirs for years, and Tsunami may be the next target. The dragonets came to the SeaWings for protection, but this ocean hides secrets, betrayal--and perhaps even death.       <br>       <br>       <br>       <br>       Book three wings of fire the hidden kingdom:       <br>       Blurb:       <br>       Glory knows the dragon world is wrong about her tribe. After all, she isn't "as lazy as a RainWing"--she isn't lazy at all! Maybe she wasn't meant to be one of the dragonets of destiny, as the older dragons constantly remind her, but Glory is sharp and her venom is deadly except, of course, no one knows it.       When the dragonets seek shelter in the rainforest, Glory is devastated to find that the treetops are full of RainWings that no dragon could ever call dangerous. They nap all day and know nothing of the rest of Pyrrhia. Worst of all, they don't realize--or care--that RainWings are going missing from their beautiful forest. But Glory and the dragonets are determined to find the missing dragons, even if it drags the peaceful RainWing kingdom where they never wanted to be--in the middle of the war.       <br>       <br>       <br>       <br>       Book four wings the dark secret:       <br>       Blurb:         <br>       In the shadows, trouble is brewing?       The mysterious NightWings keep everything hidden, from their home and their queen to their allegiance in the war. Now they've kidnapped their own dragonet of destiny, and Starflight is finally meeting the rest of his tribe--whether he wants to or not.       <br>       The NightWings have also kidnapped several innocent RainWings, now trapped in the dark, barren, miserable place that is the NightWing kingdom. Starflight wants to help the RainWings, but he's busy saving his own scales and trying to find a way back to his friends. The fate of two kingdoms rests in his talons, and with no one to save him, Starflight will have to find a way to be brave before it's too late.       <br>       <br>       <br>       <br>       Book five last of the first wings of fire story arc The brightest night:              Blurb:       <br>       Sunny has always taken the Dragonet Prophecy very seriously. If Pyrrhia's dragons need her, Clay, Tsunami, Glory, and Starflight to end the war, she's ready to try. She even has some good ideas how to do it, if anyone would listen to her.       But shattering news from Morrowseer has shaken Sunny's faith in their destiny. Is it possible for anyone to end this terrible war and choose a new SandWing queen? What if everything they've been through was for nothing?       Buried secrets, deadly surprises, and an unexpected side to scavengers are all waiting for her in the shifting sands of the desert, where Sunny must decide once and for all: Is her destiny already written?       Or can five dragonets change their fate and save the world the way they choose?       <br>       <br>       <br>       <br>       Wings of first of the second story arc moon rising:       <br>       Blurb:        <br>       The war between the tribes is finally over, and now the dragonets of the prophecy have a plan for lasting peace: Jade Mountain Academy, a school that will gather dragonets from all the tribes and teach them to live together, perhaps even as friends.       Moonwatcher isn't sure how she feels about school, however. Hidden in the rainforest for most of her life, the young NightWing has an awful secret. She can read minds, and even see the future. Living in a cave with dozens of other dragons is noisy, exhausting -- and dangerous.       In just a few days, Moon finds herself overwhelmed by her secret powers and bombarded by strange thoughts, including those of a mysterious dragon who might be a terrible enemy. And when someone starts attacking dragons within the academy, Moon has a choice to make: Stay hidden and safe? Or risk everything to save her new friends?       <br>       <br>       <br>       <br>       Wings of fire book seven Winter Turning:       <br>       Blurb:       <br>       Winter has been a disappointment to his royal IceWing family his whole life. When his sister, Icicle, runs away from Jade Mountain Academy, fleeing terrible crimes and possibly planning to commit more, Winter knows that they both need a second chance to make things right -- if only he can find her.       Winter's new classmates, Moon, Qibli, and Kinkajou, won?t let him make this dangerous journey alone. They don't seem to understand that IceWings, the most superior of all dragon tribes, can fix their own problems. When their search leads the dragonets straight into Queen Scarlet?s vicious talons, Winter is grateful to have some help. But even the bravest dragons can't follow him to the Ice Kingdom, where he'll have to face the greatest threat of all: his own family.       <br>       <br>       <br>       <br>              Book eight wings of fire escaping peril:       Blurb:       <br>       Peril has been loyal to Queen Scarlet, who used her fatal firescales to kill countless dragons in the SkyWing arena. Now, Peril is loyal to Clay, the only dragonet who has ever been her friend. So when Scarlet threatens Jade Mountain Academy, Peril sets off to find her former queen, stop her, and save the day, no matter what it takes.       There's just one problem: a strangely persistent SeaWing, Turtle, insists on coming along, too. Turtle is worried about his friends, who left to search for Scarlet and haven't returned. Peril is worried that she might accidentally burn Turtle  or burn him on purpose, for being so annoying  and frustrated that she keeps saying and doing the wrong things. She can't escape her firescales, and she can't escape her reputation as the deadliest dragon in Pyrrhia.       So when she's offered a chance to trade everything for a new life, Peril has to decide who she's really loyal to and whether her own scales might actually be worth saving.       <br>       <br>       <br>       <br>       Book nine wings of fire talons of power:       <br>        Blurb:       <br>       Turtle isn’t one of the heroes he reads about in stories. If he were, he’d use his animus powers to help Pyrrhia—instead of keeping his abilities a secret, even from his own sister. Now that Darkstalker, the sinister and impossibly old dragon from Pyrrhia’s most notorious legends, has returned, Turtle knows his own role is simple: hide. And stay hidden.              But the more he watches Darkstalker from the shadows, the more Turtle knows that someone needs to stop the powerful dragon. A real hero. But Turtle is running out of time to find one, which means…he might have to try to save the day himself.       <br>       <br>       <br>       <br>       Book ten wings of fire darkness of dragons:       <br>        Blurb:       <br>       Qibli knows Darkstalker must be stopped. And he knows he could stop him -- if he had magic. With even a sliver of the ancient dragon's all-powerful scroll, Qibli could rewrite history the right way: end war forever; make every dragon happy; perhaps even cast a very small spell so that everyone would like him...       Instead, as Darkstalkers dangerous influence spreads across Pyrrhia, entrancing or killing every dragon in the seven tribes, Qibli can only grasp the small animus objects he's borrowed from Turtle. With some clever thinking, Qibli's talons finally hold the power to make a difference.       But prophecies are not easy to rewrite. Can Qibli be the magical force Pyrrhia needs, or will he be the one to bring Jade Mountain -- and his family, his friends, his whole world -- crashing down?       <br>       <br>       <br>       <br>       Book eleven wings of fire the lost continent (the last story arc)       <br>       Blurb:       <br>       For centuries there have been rumors of another continent on the dragons' planet: another land far across the ocean, populated by tribes of dragons very different from those we know. But there's never been any evidence, and most dragons dismissed the rumors as fairy tales.       Until now.       Because it turns out the stories are true.

Whenever the queen takes control of all the HiveWings, speaking through their mouths and seeing through their eyes, Cricket has to hide, terrified of being discovered.              Now she's hiding again, wanted for stealing the Book of Clearsight along with her new SilkWing friends, Blue and Swordtail, and the fierce LeafWing, Sundew. The fugitives need answers, and fast, in order to prevent a LeafWing attack. But Cricket has more questions than ever. How can she stay hidden and discover the queen's deadliest secret?

Every tree, that is, except the wild and dangerous Poison Jungle, where the surviving LeafWings have been hiding since the war. Hiding, plotting, and waiting for a dragon like Sundew, who is uniquely qualified to bring down the Hives.              There are dark secrets in the jungle, though — some that Sundew is keeping, and some that she's only just beginning to discover. And now that a new war is upon them, Sundew and her friends must unearth the oldest secret in the jungle-even if what they find has the power to destroy them all.        bookthree is the capital of Japan.

    //canasta
text.push("How to play Canasta hands shuffling cards Requires: a double pack of cards, or two identical packs shuffled together.  diamond Overview Your goal is to beat your opponent by scoring more points. You score points by melding cards, and making as many canastas as possible. A canasta is a meld of at least seven cards of the same rank.  Each player starts with 12 cards in their hand. Both players take turns in drawing one card from the deck, and discarding one card on the discard pile (in that order).  After drawing a card, a player may meld cards if they want to. Cards are melded in columns of at least three cards; e.g. you can meld three Kings, or four Fives. You cannot meld sequences like Four-Five-Six. Once a card has been melded, it cannot be taken back into the hand.  When a player has melded their cards, they end their turn by discarding a card. At that point, their melded cards are checked to see if they conform to the canasta rules. Discarding a card is not necessary if the player can go out by melding all of their cards.  Instead of drawing a card from the deck, a player may take the entire discard pile. However, this is only allowed if they can directly meld the top card.  A hand is over when one of the players has no cards left in their hand, or when there are no cards left on the stock. The scores of both players are then computed and added to the scores, and a new hand is dealt. A player can only finish a hand when they have at least one canasta.  A canasta match is over when one of the players reaches a chosen number of points.  spade Rules If a rank is melded, it must contain at least three cards on the table.  It is possible to add a wildcard to a column of cards of any rank on the table. The wildcard is then seen as a card of that rank (but the value remains unchanged). However, there may never be more wildcards than natural cards within one meld.  At the beginning of a hand, the top card of the deck is turned over and placed on the discard pile. If this card is a Red Three or a wildcard, the procedure is repeated until the top card of the discard pile is neither a Red Three nor a wildcard. When a new hand is dealt, the hands of both players are checked to see if they contain a Red Three. If there is one, that Three is then automatically melded, and an extra card is dealt to the hand out of which it came. This procedure is repeated until neither player has any Red Threes left in their hand.  Black Threes may not be melded, except when the player can go out by melding a column of three or four Black Threes. These Black Threes must then be the last cards to be melded.  The discard pile can be frozen by discarding a wildcard or a Red Three. A freeze means that both players are only allowed to take the discard pile if they can meld the top card using only the cards in their hand, as if they had no cards on the table. For example, if the discard pile is frozen and the top card is a Seven, the pile may only be taken if the player has two Sevens in their hand, even though they have a column of three Sevens on the table. Also, no wildcards may be used in melding: if they have one Seven and a wildcard in hand - instead of two Sevens- they may not take the discard pile.  If you have taken the discard pile but discover that you cannot use the top card, you must put the cards that were in the discard pile back, and lose 50 points.  It is never allowed to take the discard pile when the top card is a Black Three, a Red Three or a wildcard. Thus, Black Threes can be used to freeze the pile for a single turn.  The first time a player melds cards in a hand, their value must be at least a certain minimum.  A player can only go out when they have at least one canasta.  Taking a discard pile that only contains one card is never allowed.  When there are no more cards on the deck, the scores of both players are computed and added to their score.  heart Scoring: card values and bonuses These cards have the following values: Black Three, Four 5  Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten 10  Jack, Queen, King 15  Ace,Two 20  Joker 50  Red Three 300  The following bonuses are awarded: A mixed canasta is worth 300 points, a natural canasta ( 500 points, and a wildcard canasta 1,000 points.  The player that goes out gets a bonus of 200 points for one of their canastas, and 300 in addition to the natural bonus if one of their canastas is a natural.  club Total score At the end of a hand, the total score is calculated as follows:  1. The sum of the values of the cards on the table forms the initial score value.  2. Bonuses for canastas and going out are added to the score.  3. The values of the cards in hand are deducted from the score.  diamond Minimum The first time in a hand that a player melds cards the sum of their values must be at least a certain minimum. This minimum depends on your current score in the following way:  Less than 0 None  From 0 to 995 50  From 1000 to 1995 80  From 2000 to 2995 100  3000 or more 120  The end! Now go play canasta!

Suggested materials: For construction: paper, tape, books, and lego. For chain reaction: Marbles, dominoes, balls, also lego. Try making tracks for the ball to roll down, or maybe use lego to make bigger dominoes or mechanisms. For examples, search up “Chain reaction” on Youtube. There doesn’t actually need to be something at the end.  Science bit: Each thing you set off has ‘potential energy’, usually from gravity, and releasing each things’ energy releases the next things’ energy. For example, a standing domino has potential energy because it could fall over, and when it does, it topples the next over, and so on until the end of the chain.  Back")

Two people start on opposite sides of the hoop. Everyone else lines up. 3. One person starts by throwing the ball into the circle so it bounces. 4. Then, the other person tries to hit the ball so it bounces as well. If the ball bounces again before the other person hits it, the other person is out. They are also out if they bounce it outside the circle. 5. Then it is the first person’s turn to hit the ball. Repeat until someone goes out. 6. If the first person goes out, the second person will now start with the ball, the first person goes to the back of the line, and the person who is first in line is now in but will not start with the ball. If the second person goes out, they go to the back of the line and the first person in line takes their place.   Play for as long as you want. Alternatively, with 4 or more people, everyone can try and get a “Round the world” by getting out every person in the game, including finally themselves. It only counts if they stay in the game while they are doing this.  Back")
