            1. Choose someone to be the tagger. Everyone else sits in a circle.<br />
            2. The tagger runs around the circle tapping on everyone's heads and saying "Duck". At some point, the tagger taps on someone's head and says "Goose!".<br />
            3. The person who is the "Goose" chases the tagger around the circle. If they catch the tagger, the tagger is in for the next round. If they don't before the tagger reaches their place in the circle, the tagger sits there and the 'goose' is now the tagger.
