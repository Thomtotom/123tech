    <p>


        Requires: a normal deck of cards<br />
        <br />
        1. Deal each player seven cards.<br />
        <br />
        2. Take the top card of the deck and turn it over next to the deck. This will be the
        discard pile.<br />
        <br />
        3. Start your turn by picking up. You can either pick up the top card of the deck or pick
        up the whole discard pile. At the beginning of the game, the only card in the pile is the one
        you turned over before.<br />
        <br />
        4. Once you have picked up, you can play down sets in your hand, then you must throw out a card
        into the discard pile.<br />
        <br />
        5. A set can be two things: 3 or more cards with the same number, or 3 or more consecutive cards
        of the same suit. Once you have played down a set, you can extend it without having to play down
        3 more cards. Your opponent can also extend your sets by playing a card down with their other
        cards. You can extend from this, and they can extend from that, and so on.You can also
        extend from your own extensions.<br />
        <br />
        6. To win, a player must have the most points when the game is ended. The game ends when someone
        throws out their last card.<br />
        <br />

        7. Scoring: the player who did not throw out their last card loses the point value of the cards
        in their hand, and the other player gains those points. Point values are the number for number
        cards, and 10 for picture cards, including aces.<br />
        <br />
        Now that youâ€™ve read the rules, go play Gin Rummy!<br />
