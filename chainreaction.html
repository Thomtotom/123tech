<h1>Chain reactions</h1>
<p>Try making an incredibly complicated machine to perform a simple task. For example, pulling up a piece of cardboard that releases a ball that rolls down a chute and lands on a catapult that launches a smaller ball onto another track, which knocks down a domino, which knocks down another domino, with the dominoes getting slowly bigger until one hits the light switch. 
<br><br>
Suggested materials: For construction: paper, tape, books, and lego. For chain reaction: Marbles, dominoes, balls, also lego. Try making tracks for the ball to roll down, or maybe use lego to make bigger dominoes or mechanisms. For examples, search up “Chain reaction” on Youtube. There doesn’t actually need to be something at the end. 
<br><br>
Science bit: Each thing you set off has ‘potential energy’, usually from gravity, and releasing each things’ energy releases the next things’ energy. For example, a standing domino has potential energy because it could fall over, and when it does, it topples the next over, and so on until the end of the chain.</p>
