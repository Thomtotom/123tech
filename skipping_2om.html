    <h1>Skipping 2 or more people</h1>
    <h2>Long skipping</h2>
    <h3>Requires: Long skipping rope, 3 or more people</h3>
    <p>
        Two people stand at each end of the long skipping rope and stretch it so it is slightly slack. They swing it around at the same time while the third person tries to do some trick. Everyone else lines up. <br />
        There are lots of different tricks someone can do: <br />
        Run under<br />
        Run under and back(need to jump to get back)<br />
        Run under and do one jump
        Run under and do as many jumps as you can<br />
        Alternatively, you can try to have more people try to do the tricks all at once.

    <h3>Two-person skipping</h3>
    <h4>Requires: Medium skipping rope</h4>
    <p>Two people stand next to each other and skip as if they were a single person and skip. Each person can alternately jump out and start swinging while the other person keeps doing it.  </p>
    <h3>Helicopter</h3>
    <h4>Requires: 3 or more people, short skipping rope</h4>
    <p>One person stands in the center and everyone else makes a circle around them, as far away as the length of the skipping rope. The person in the  center swings the skipping rope around and everyone tries to jump over it. If someone is hit by the skipping rope, they swap places with the person in the center. Alternatively, every time someone is hit, they are eliminated. This is recommended for larger groups. </p>
