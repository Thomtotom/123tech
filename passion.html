<h1> Passion project</h1>

<p>Passion project is something that you can do to learn more about something that you want to know more about. You search things up, find things out and then you present what you learned. Try checking out library books on the subject, or finding someone who knows about what you’re researching. Then show everyone what you’ve learned! </p>
