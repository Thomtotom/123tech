        <h1>KO</h1>
        <h2>12 or more people, half as many people minus 1 chairs, a stopwatch</h2>
        <p>
            1. Line up the chairs in a row, direction alternating between one side and the other. Divide the players into two teams. If there is an odd number of people, one person will run for both teams.<br />
            2. One team chooses a person to be the tagger for the first round, who goes to one end of the chairs. The rest of that team sit on the chairs.
            3. The other team lines up at the other end of the chairs.<br />
            4. Someone starts the timer, the first person in the line and the tagger start running.<br />
            5. The person who was in line can run between the chairs, the tagger can only run around the ends.<br />
            6. The tagger can tag the back of a chair, and then the person in that chair is the new tagger, and the tagger sits in that chair.<br />
            7. As soon as the first person in line is tagged, they are out, and the second person starts running.<br />
            8. When the last person is tagged, the stopwatch is stopped.<br />
            9. The teams swap places and repeat.<br />
            10. The team who took the longest time wins.
