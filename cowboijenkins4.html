    <h1>Learn to play Gin Rummy</h1>
    <p>


        Requires: a normal deck of cards<br />
        <br />
        1. Deal each player seven cards.<br />
        <br />
        2. Take the top card of the deck and turn it over next to the deck. This will be the <br />
        discard pile.<br />
        <br />
        3. Start your turn by picking up. You can either pick up the top card of the deck or pick <br />
        up the whole discard pile. At the beginning of the game, the only card in the pile is the one <br />
        you turned over before.<br />
        <br />
        4. Once you have picked up, you can play down sets in your hand, then you must throw out a card <br />
        into the discard pile.<br />
        <br />
        5. A set can be two things: 3 or more cards with the same number, or 3 or more consecutive cards <br />
        of the same suit. Once you have played down a set, you can extend it without having to play down <br />
        3 more cards. Your opponent can also extend your sets by playing a card down with their other <br />
        cards. You can extend from this, and they can extend from that, and so on.You can also <br />
        extend from your own extensions.<br />
        <br />
        6. To win, a player must have the most points when the game is ended. The game ends when someone <br />
        throws out their last card.<br />
        <br />

        7. Scoring: the player who did not throw out their last card loses the point value of the cards <br />
        in their hand, and the other player gains those points. Point values are the number for number <br />
        cards, and 10 for picture cards, including aces.<br />
        <br />
        Now that you’ve read the rules, go play Gin Rummy!<br />
