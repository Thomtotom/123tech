          <h1>What is this website about?</h1>
          <p>This website is about finding the best activity in the least time.
              Unlike Google; our website has a series of questions that then
          
              narrows the activities that you're looking for, in addition to a search bar. 
              We have many choices but we recommend
         our tag page it has more than 17 different 
              tag games!
              We can also recommend our card game page.
          </p>
