    <h1> Make your own board game</h1>
    <p>
        Requires:Paper, pencil/pen<br />

        1. Start with a piece of butcher paper if you have it, or if you don’t, several sheets of A4 paper <br />
        taped together ON THE BACK. Do not tape the sheets together on the front or you will not be able <br />
        to draw on them partly.<br />
        2. The first thing to do is draw a board. Draw a square labelled ‘start’, then a square labelled ‘finish’<br />
        away from that.<br />
    </p>

    <p>
        3. After that, draw a long path between the two squares, trying to use all of the board.<br />

    </p>

    <p>
        4. Then, divide the path up into squares.<br />



    </p>
    <img src="myobg3.png" alt="squares" width="600" height="400" />
    <p>
        5. After that, label some of the squares with one symbol, anything you want, and an equal amount <br />
        with another symbol. These will be the squares which let you pick a card. One will be good cards <br />
        and the other will be bad cards. Randomly space them. Here B is bad and G is good.<br />

    <p>
        6. Add portals. Portals can send you forward, bring you back, or go both ways. When drawn, show that<br />
        they are linked by drawing a line between them. Use arrows to indicate the direction. Make <br />
        sure to think carefully about the position of your portals and whether they will make the game <br />
        too easy or too hard.<br />

    <p>
        7. OK, that’s your board done! Now you need a couple more touches. First, get two sheets of coloured<br />
        paper and divide them up into equal rectangles. These will be your cards.<br />

    </p>
    <img src="myobg6.png" alt="blank cards" width="600" height="400" />
    <p>
        8. Now label your cards. Generally, the good cards are the opposite of the bad ones, and the more <br />
        powerful a card, the rarer. Do whatever you want based on these rules. <br />
        You can also add challenges which give boosts if completed, such as dancing for a minute or <br />
        playing paper-scissors-rock with your opponents.<br />

    <p>
        9. The final step is to customise the game. Will it be the forces of good and darkness racing to the<br />
        Diamond of power, or a cow race? This includes the pieces, which can be anything that can fit<br />
        in the squares. Similarly, the cards could be magical loot or food, and the portals could be <br />
        teleporters or speed boosts. Note: the cards and portals are not necessary, but we recommend at <br />
        least one to make the game interesting.<br />

    <h2>
        How to play
    </h2>

    <p>
        1. Shuffle the cards and deal into piles. Choose the order of players in any way you like. <br />
        2. When you roll, go forward that number of spaces.<br />
        3. If you land on a card square, pick up the relevant card and follow the instructions. Then put<br />
        the card at the bottom of the deck.<br />
        4. If you land on a portal, check which way you should go.<br />
        5. If you land on a square with another player, that player misses their next turn.<br />
        6. First to the finish wins.<br />
