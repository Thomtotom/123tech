    <h1>Skipping (one person)</h1>
    <h2>Requires: skipping rope</h2>
    <h4>To test the length of your skipping rope, stand on it in the middle. It should go up to around your waist. </h4>
    <h3>Skipping</h3>
    <p>Hold the skipping rope with a bit on the ground behind you. Swing over your head and down to your feet, but just before it reaches your feet, jump. Repeat as long as you want.</p>
    <h3>Backwards skipping</h3>
    <p>This time, start with the skipping rope on the ground in front of you and swing backwards over your head so that it hits the ground behind you, then jump. This is harder because you can’t see before you jump. </p>
    <h3>Hula hoop skipping</h3>
    <h5>Requires: hula hoop</h5>
    <p>Basically the same as ordinary skipping but you use the hoop. Start with the hula hoop touching the ground behind you, swing over your head and jump through.</p>
    <h3>
        There are several different tricks you can do, but we cannot describe them with only text.
