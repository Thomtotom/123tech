        Mr Spud is drawing up plans for a new rectangular vegetable plot. He’s planning to border the plot with wooden planks that are exactly 1 meter in length. If he does not want a square plot, what is the smallest number of planks that he would need if numerically he wants to make a number also equal to the area?

Each corner will have one extra plank, so to make the perimeter equal to the area there must be exactly 4 square meters with no boundaries. The four squares can only be arranged in two ways, in a 2x2 square, which leads to a square with perimeter and area 16, or a 1x4 rectangle which leads to a rectangle with perimeter and area 18. The first is a square, but the second is a rectangle. The solution is 18."

If the range is 5, then the highest and lowest numbers must be of the following: 0-5, 1-6, 2-7, 3-8, 4-9, or 5-10. 0-5 and 5-10 are impossible because you can't find numbers to make the mean 5. 1-6 and 4-9  are also impossible because you can't find numbers without making something else also the mode. We now have four possibilities: 255_7, 355_8, 3_558, and 2_557. for the first, the total is 19, so the remaining one must be 6. This checks, so 25567 is a solution.

It is obvious that a 2 occurs many more times than 5, so we can count the fives. 5, 10 ,15,...95, 100. All 20 divide by 5 once, except for 25, 50, 75, and 100, which divide twice. So the answer is 24. <br />For the record, 100!=93,326,215,443,944,152,681,699,238,856,266,700,490,715,968,264,381,621,468,592,963,895,217,599,993,229,915,608,941,463,976,156,518,286,253,697,920,827,223,758,251,185,210,916,864,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000."
