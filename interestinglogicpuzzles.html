            1 Four friends are crossing a bridge at night. It is very rickety, only able to support two people and they only have one torch, which everyone crossing must use. If a pair travel across, they must travel at the speed of the slower person. Alice can cross in 1 minute, Ben in 2, Charlie in 5, and Deelisa in 10. What is the fastest way for them to get over the bridge?

            Three friends, Fred, George, and Harold are playing a game. Each person chooses someone to aim at, and rolls a die to decide whether they succeed. If they succeed, that person is out. Fred succeeds ⅓ of the time, George ⅔, and Harold all the time. Fred gets to go first, followed by George then Harold. Who should Fred aim at to win?

            Two brothers, Harry and Owen, are mucking around in the garden. They can see each other’s faces, but not their own. Their mother tells them at least one of them has a muddy face. She asks them to stand with their backs against the wall. “Step forward if you have a muddy face” she says. Nothing happens. She repeats, “Step forward if you have a muddy face”. What happens and why?

            The 100 pirates on the ship <i>The banana</i> are very democratic. When they get some treasure, the oldest pirate proposes a way to divide the loot and everyone votes. If there is a majority or equal, the plan goes ahead, and if there is not, the pirate is thrown overboard and the next eldest tries. Recently, they have stolen 100 dubloons. What will give the eldest the most money?

If he bribes pirate #1, however, pirate number 1 will vote for him since if #1 votes against, pirate #2 will take the lot. With 4, the eldest must make one bribe. Pirate #3 and 1 will vote against him, but pirate #2 will get nothing in pirate #3’s proposal, so will vote for pirate #4 if he is given anything. A pattern is coming here.

            Two people are sharing a cake. How can they divide it so each person thinks they have at least their fair share?
            Bonus: What about 3 people?

The other person chooses, thinking the piece they choose is at least half of the cake. <br />With three (or more), one person moves the knife along the cake. As soon as someone wants the piece shown, they yell “Cut!” and that person gets the piece. Repeat until no one is left, then the cutter gets the rest."
