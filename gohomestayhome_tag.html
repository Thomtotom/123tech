        2. Choose an area which the tagger can stay inside. This is not always necessary, but will make the game easier.<br />
        3. Choose a tagger. They will guard the base.<br />
        4. The tagger counts to 20 while everyone hides.<br />
        5. Everyone tries to get to the base. If they are tagged, they are out, and if they make it, they have won.<br />
