        Hello and welcome to our website!<br />
        <br />
        This website is an activity index, which hopes to help people learn many things.<br />
        Te Reo Maori is one of the courses you can choose from. There are lots of educational <br />
        games on a range of subjects.  We are from Wellington, New Zealand.<br />
        <br />
        We are competing in a competition called 123tech.  123tech is about young coders and <br />
        problem solvers having the opportunity to make an app or a website. If you were to join, <br />
        you would contribute to solving a problem in your community by using digital technology.<br />
        <br />
        We hope you enjoy it!<br />
        <br />
