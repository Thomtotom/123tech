    <h1>Circleball</h1>
    <h2>Requires: chalk or hula hoop, small bouncy ball, concrete surface. </h2>
    <h2>How to play:</h2>
    <p>
        1. Place the hula hoop on the ground or draw a circle with the chalk. <br />
        2. Two people start on opposite sides of the hoop. Everyone else lines up. <br />
        3. One person starts by throwing the ball into the circle so it bounces. <br />
        4. Then, the other person tries to hit the ball so it bounces as well. If the ball bounces again before the other person hits it, the other person is out. They are also out if they bounce it outside the circle. <br />
        5. Then it is the first person’s turn to hit the ball. Repeat until someone goes  out. <br />
        6. If the first person goes out, the second person will now start with the ball, the first person goes to the back of the line, and the person who is first in line is now in but will not start with the ball. If the second person goes out, they go to the back of the line and the first person in line takes their place.

    <p>Play for as long as you want. Alternatively, with 4 or more people, everyone can try and get a “Round the world” by getting out every person in the game, including finally themselves. It only counts if they stay in the game while they are doing this. </p>
