    <h3>booktwo</h3>
    <p>
      Wings of fire has a trilogy story arc with a total of thirteen books it will take you a while. The first trilogy is kind of the origin story for the second story arc but at the same time something completely new as in  story wise. It is definity recommended that you read these in order or else it does not make sense. The second story arc is very fun to read. It ticks all of my boxe’s: has a villain, a kind of dream team and a power that seems untouchable. The third and probably finill arc has a very unexpected twist where the story instead of  taking place in the original world takes place in a completely different setting. I myself loved this part. 
      <br><br>
      Prophecy of arc one:
      When the war has lasted twenty years...
      the dragonets will come.
      When the land is soaked in blood and tears...
      the dragonets will come.
      <br><br>
      Find the SeaWing egg of deepest blue.
      Wings of night shall come to you.
      The largest egg in mountain high
      will give to you the wings of sky.
      For wings of earth, search through the mud
      for an egg the color of dragon blood.
      And hidden alone from the rival queens,
      the SandWing egg awaits unseen.
      
      Of three queens who blister and blaze and burn,
      two shall die and one shall learn
      if she bows to a fate that is stronger and higher,
      she'll have the power of wings of fire.
      <br>
      <br>
      Five eggs to hatch on brightest night,
      five dragons born to end the fight.
      Darkness will rise to bring the light.
      The dragonets are coming...
      <br><br>
      
      <br><br>
      
      Book one wings of fire dragonet prophecy:
      Blurb:clay has lived his whole life under the mountain. The Mudwing dragonet knows that war is raging between the dragon tribes in the world outside - a war that he and four other dragonets are destined to end, according to the mysterious prophecy they’ve been taught. The five “chosen” dragonets were stolen from their homes while they were still in there eggs - and hidden away for years - all to fulfill the prophecy.
      <br>
      But not every dragonet wants a destiny. And when danger threatens one of their own, Clay and his friends may choose freedom over fate …. Leave the mountain …. And set the dragon world on course that no one could have predicted.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Book two wings of fire the lost heir:
       <br>
      blurb:
      <br>
      She can't believe it's finally happening. Tsunami and her fellow dragonets of destiny are journeying under the water to the great SeaWing Kingdom. Stolen as an egg from the royal hatchery, Tsunami is eager to meet her future subjects and reunite with her mother, Queen Coral.
      <br>
      But Tsunami's triumphant return doesn't go quite the way she imagined. Queen Coral welcomes her with open wings, but a mysterious assassin has been killing off the queen's heirs for years, and Tsunami may be the next target.

      Book three wings of fire the hidden kingdom:
      <br>
      Blurb:
      <br>
      Glory knows the dragon world is wrong about her tribe. After all, she isn't "as lazy as a RainWing"--she isn't lazy at all! Maybe she wasn't meant to be one of the dragonets of destiny, as the older dragons constantly remind her, but Glory is sharp and her venom is deadly except, of course, no one knows it.
      When the dragonets seek shelter in the rainforest, Glory is devastated to find that the treetops are full of RainWings that no dragon could ever call dangerous. They nap all day and know nothing of the rest of Pyrrhia. Worst of all, they don't realize--or care--that RainWings are going missing from their beautiful forest. But Glory and the dragonets are determined to find the missing dragons, even if it drags the peaceful RainWing kingdom where they never wanted to be--in the middle of the war.

      <br>
      The NightWings have also kidnapped several innocent RainWings, now trapped in the dark, barren, miserable place that is the NightWing kingdom. Starflight wants to help the RainWings, but he's busy saving his own scales and trying to find a way back to his friends. The fate of two kingdoms rests in his talons, and with no one to save him, Starflight will have to find a way to be brave before it's too late.

      Blurb:
      <br>
      Sunny has always taken the Dragonet Prophecy very seriously. If Pyrrhia's dragons need her, Clay, Tsunami, Glory, and Starflight to end the war, she's ready to try. She even has some good ideas how to do it, if anyone would listen to her.
      But shattering news from Morrowseer has shaken Sunny's faith in their destiny. Is it possible for anyone to end this terrible war and choose a new SandWing queen? What if everything they've been through was for nothing?
      Buried secrets, deadly surprises, and an unexpected side to scavengers are all waiting for her in the shifting sands of the desert, where Sunny must decide once and for all: Is her destiny already written?

      Blurb: 
      <br>
      The war between the tribes is finally over, and now the dragonets of the prophecy have a plan for lasting peace: Jade Mountain Academy, a school that will gather dragonets from all the tribes and teach them to live together, perhaps even as friends.
      Moonwatcher isn't sure how she feels about school, however. Hidden in the rainforest for most of her life, the young NightWing has an awful secret. She can read minds, and even see the future. Living in a cave with dozens of other dragons is noisy, exhausting -- and dangerous.
      In just a few days, Moon finds herself overwhelmed by her secret powers and bombarded by strange thoughts, including those of a mysterious dragon who might be a terrible enemy. And when someone starts attacking dragons within the academy, Moon has a choice to make: Stay hidden and safe? Or risk everything to save her new friends?
      <br>
      <br>

      <br>
      Blurb:
      <br>
      Winter has been a disappointment to his royal IceWing family his whole life. When his sister, Icicle, runs away from Jade Mountain Academy, fleeing terrible crimes and possibly planning to commit more, Winter knows that they both need a second chance to make things right -- if only he can find her.
      Winter's new classmates, Moon, Qibli, and Kinkajou, won?t let him make this dangerous journey alone. They don't seem to understand that IceWings, the most superior of all dragon tribes, can fix their own problems. When their search leads the dragonets straight into Queen Scarlet?s vicious talons, Winter is grateful to have some help.

      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      
      Book eight wings of fire escaping peril:
      Blurb:
      <br>
      Peril has been loyal to Queen Scarlet, who used her fatal firescales to kill countless dragons in the SkyWing arena. Now, Peril is loyal to Clay, the only dragonet who has ever been her friend. So when Scarlet threatens Jade Mountain Academy, Peril sets off to find her former queen, stop her, and save the day, no matter what it takes.
      There's just one problem: a strangely persistent SeaWing, Turtle, insists on coming along, too. Turtle is worried about his friends, who left to search for Scarlet and haven't returned. Peril is worried that she might accidentally burn Turtle  or burn him on purpose, for being so annoying  and frustrated that she keeps saying and doing the wrong things. She can't escape her firescales, and she can't escape her reputation as the deadliest dragon in Pyrrhia.
      So when she's offered a chance to trade everything for a new life, Peril has to decide who she's really loyal to and whether her own scales might actually be worth saving.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Book nine wings of fire talons of power:
      <br>
       Blurb:
      <br>
      Turtle isn’t one of the heroes he reads about in stories. If he were, he’d use his animus powers to help Pyrrhia—instead of keeping his abilities a secret, even from his own sister. Now that Darkstalker, the sinister and impossibly old dragon from Pyrrhia’s most notorious legends, has returned, Turtle knows his own role is simple: hide. And stay hidden.
      
      But the more he watches Darkstalker from the shadows, the more Turtle knows that someone needs to stop the powerful dragon. A real hero. But Turtle is running out of time to find one, which means…he might have to try to save the day himself.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Book ten wings of fire darkness of dragons:
      <br> 
      Blurb:
      <br>
      Qibli knows Darkstalker must be stopped. And he knows he could stop him -- if he had magic. With even a sliver of the ancient dragon's all-powerful scroll, Qibli could rewrite history the right way: end war forever; make every dragon happy; perhaps even cast a very small spell so that everyone would like him...
      Instead, as Darkstalkers dangerous influence spreads across Pyrrhia, entrancing or killing every dragon in the seven tribes, Qibli can only grasp the small animus objects he's borrowed from Turtle. With some clever thinking, Qibli's talons finally hold the power to make a difference.
      But prophecies are not easy to rewrite. Can Qibli be the magical force Pyrrhia needs, or will he be the one to bring Jade Mountain -- and his family, his friends, his whole world -- crashing down?
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>

      For centuries there have been rumors of another continent on the dragons' planet: another land far across the ocean, populated by tribes of dragons very different from those we know. But there's never been any evidence, and most dragons dismissed the rumors as fairy tales.

      Every tree, that is, except the wild and dangerous Poison Jungle, where the surviving LeafWings have been hiding since the war. Hiding, plotting, and waiting for a dragon like Sundew, who is uniquely qualified to bring down the Hives.
      
      There are dark secrets in the jungle, though — some that Sundew is keeping, and some that she's only just beginning to discover. And now that a new war is upon them, Sundew and her friends must unearth the oldest secret in the jungle-even if what they find has the power to destroy them all.
