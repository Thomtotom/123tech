  <p>The Half-Men of O is a fantastic book. Two people called Nick and Susan are kidnapped and taken to the land of O, where they learn that they are the only ones who can save O from the evil Odo Cling. 
    In the sequel, The Priests of Ferris, Nick and Susan return to O to find that 60 years have passed, and some people have created a brutal religion based on Susan. Once again, they must save O from this. 
    In the third and final book, Motherstone, just as they are about to return to  their own world, Susan is kidnapped by another evil force which has enlisted the people of the fiery northern lands to wage war, and is building a Weapon which could destroy the balance of O. When Susan first placed the halves of good and evil, they were not equal, and the only hope for O lies in balancing them.

Susan had always been a bit odd and never really got on with her cousin Nick, but the mark on her wrist draws them together in a frightening adventure. They are summoned to the beautiful land of O in a last-ditch attempt to save the planet from cruel Otis Claw and his followers, the evil Halfmen, who have lost every trace of human goodness and kindness.
