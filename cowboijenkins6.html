    <h1>Learn to play last card</h1>
    <p>
        1. Deal each player 7 cards. <br />
        <br />
        2. Flip the top card of the deck over. This will be the discard pile.<br />
        <br />
        3. Players decide who will go first.<br />
        <br />
        4. On your turn, you can play down a card, as long as the card below it is the same suit or rank.<br />
        <br />
        5. Instead, you can play down multiple cards of the same rank, as long as the bottom of the cards <br />
        you play down can be played onto the card below it. <br />
        <br />
        6. If you can't play anything, you must pick up a card from the deck.<br />
        <br />
        7. Some cards have special powers. If you play down a 5, the next player must pick up 5. If <br />
        they can play down a  5 as well, that 5 is added to the total, and the next player has to pick<br />
        10. If they can play a 5, the next player has to pick up 15, and if they can play a 5, the next <br />
        has to pick up 20. The same thing happens with 2s, but only picking up 2 per 2 played. 10 makes <br />
        the next player miss a turn,  and an ace changes the suit to your choice. You can add other rules <br />
        cards, but these are the fundamental ones.<br />
        <br />
        8. If you have only one card in your hand, or a set of cards of the same rank, you MUST say "last card".<br />
        If you do not say "last card", you must pick up four cards. It does not matter whether these are playable.<br />
        If you play your last card, you have won.<br />
        <br />
        9. If the draw pile is out of cards, take the top card of the discard pile and put it to the side as the<br />
        new discard pile, then flip the discard pile over and use it as the draw pile. Repeat until someone wins.<br />
        <br />
