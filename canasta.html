    <h2> Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Your goal is to beat your opponent by scoring more points. You score points by melding<br />
        cards, and making as many canastas as possible. A canasta is a meld of at least seven<br />
        cards of the same rank.<br />
        <br />
        Each player starts with 12 cards in their hand.<br />
        Both players take turns in drawing one card from the deck, and discarding one card on the <br />
        discard pile (in that order).<br />
        <br />
        After drawing a card, a player may meld cards if they want to. Cards are melded in columns<br />
        of at least three cards; e.g. you can meld three Kings, or four Fives. You cannot meld <br />
        sequences like Four-Five-Six. Once a card has been melded, it cannot be taken back into the<br />
        hand.<br />
        <br />
        When a player has melded their cards, they end their turn by discarding a card. At that <br />
        point, their melded cards are checked to see if they conform to the canasta rules. Discarding <br />
        a card is not necessary if the player can go out by melding all of their cards.<br />
        <br />
        Instead of drawing a card from the deck, a player may take the entire discard pile. <br />
        However, this is only allowed if they can directly meld the top card.<br />
        <br />
        A hand is over when one of the players has no cards left in their hand, or when there  <br />
        are no cards left on the stock. The scores of both players are then computed and added to  <br />
        the scores, and a new hand is dealt. A player can only finish a hand when they have at least  <br />
        one canasta. <br />
        <br />
        A canasta match is over when one of the players reaches a chosen number of points.<br />
        <br />

    <h2> Rules </h2>
    <p>
        If a rank is melded, it must contain at least three cards on the table.<br />
        <br />
        It is possible to add a wildcard to a column of cards of any rank on the table. The <br />
        wildcard is then seen as a card of that rank (but the value remains unchanged).<br />
        However, there may never be more wildcards than natural cards within one meld.<br />
        <br />
        At the beginning of a hand, the top card of the deck is turned over and placed on the <br />
        discard pile. If this card is a Red Three or a wildcard, the procedure is repeated until <br />
        the top card of the discard pile is neither a Red Three nor a wildcard.
        When a new hand is dealt, the hands of both players are checked to see if they contain a Red<br />

        Three. If there is one, that Three is then automatically melded, and an extra card is dealt to <br />
        the hand out of which it came. This procedure is repeated until neither player has any Red Threes <br />
        left in their hand.<br />
        <br />
        Black Threes may not be melded, except when the player can go out by melding a column of three or<br />
        four Black Threes. These Black Threes must then be the last cards to be melded.<br />
        <br />
        The discard pile can be frozen by discarding a wildcard or a Red Three. A freeze means that both <br />
        players are only allowed to take the discard pile if they can meld the top card using only the <br />
        cards in their hand, as if they had no cards on the table. For example, if the discard pile is <br />
        frozen and the top card is a Seven, the pile may only be taken if the player has two Sevens in <br />
        their hand, even though they have a column of three Sevens on the table. Also, no wildcards may <br />
        be used in melding: if they have one Seven and a wildcard in hand - instead of two Sevens- they <br />
        may not take the discard pile.<br />
        <br />
        If you have taken the discard pile but discover that you cannot use the top card, you must put <br />
        the cards that were in the discard pile back, and lose 50 points.<br />
        <br />
        It is never allowed to take the discard pile when the top card is a Black Three, a <br />
        Red Three or a wildcard. Thus, Black Threes can be used to freeze the pile for a single <br />
        turn.<br />
        <br />
        The first time a player melds cards in a hand, their value must be at least a certain minimum.<br />
        <br />
        A player can only go out when they have at least one canasta.<br />
        <br />
        Taking a discard pile that only contains one card is never allowed.<br />
        <br />
        When there are no more cards on the deck, the scores of both players are computed and added <br />
        to their score.<br />

    <h2>Total score</h2>
    <p>
        At the end of a hand, the total score is calculated as follows:<br />
        <br />
        1. The sum of the values of the cards on the table forms the initial score value.<br />
        <br />
        2. Bonuses for canastas and going out are added to the score.<br />
        <br />
        3. The values of the cards in hand are deducted from the score.<br />
        <br />


    </p>
    <img src="diamond.png" alt="diamond" width="40" height="40" />
    <h2> Minimum</h2>
    <p>
        The first time in a hand that a player melds cards the sum of their values must <br />
        be at least a certain minimum. This minimum depends on your current score in the following way:<br />
        <br />

        Less than 0         None<br />
        <br />
        From 0 to 995       50<br />
        <br />
        From 1000 to 1995   80<br />
        <br />
        From 2000 to 2995   100<br />
        <br />
        3000 or more        120<br />
        <br />
