    <h1> Make a boat</h1>
    <h2>There are several ways to do this:</h2>

    <h3>1. Cork boat</h3>
    <h5>This is easy to make and will not sink easily.</h5>
    <h4>Requires</h4>
    <p>
        Several corks<br />
        Rubber bands<br />
        Toothpicks<br />
        Paper<br />
        String<br />
        Colored pens or pencils<br />
    </p>
    <p>
        1. Wrap two elastic bands around the corks to hold them together.
        <br />2. Stick a toothpick upright through the middle<br />
        3. Cut out a 3cm square of paper and decorate.<br />
        4. Stick the square of paper onto the toothpick and set sail!<br />
        <i> If you are in a place where you could lose this boat, tie a string on to one of the corks.<br /></i>
    </p>


    <h3>2. Paper boat</h3>
    <h5> Although these are not very good as boats, these are easy and inexpensive to create. </h5>
    <h4> Requires</h4>
    <p>
        One sheet of paper<br />
        Tape<br />
        <br />
        <br /> 1. Fold all edges 2cm into the center
        <br /> 2. Use tape to close edges.
        <br /> 3. Now, float your boat!
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3> 3. Container boat</h3>
    <h5>In terms of sheer unsinkability and reusability, these are THE BEST.</h5>
    <h4> Requires:</h4>
    <p>
        Old plastic container<br />
        Toothpick<br />
        Paper<br />
        Colored pens and pencils<br />
        Tape<br />
        String<br />

        <br />
        <br />
        <br /> 1. Tape toothpick onto bottom of container.
        <br /> 2. Cut lengths of string long enough to stretch from the top of the toothpick to the four corners of the container. If your container is not rectangular, choose four points on the outside.
        <br />
        3.  Cut a 3cm square piece of paper and decorate. <br />
        4. Stick the piece of paper onto the toothpick.<br />
        5. Tie all four pieces of string to the top of the toothpick.<br />
        6. Tie each piece of string to a corner, as tight as possible.<br />
        7. If it is possible for you to lose this boat, you can tie on a piece of string.<br />
