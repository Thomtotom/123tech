        <h1>Chain Tag</h1>
        <h2>10 or more people</h2>
        <p>Someone starts as "in". If they tag someone else, they link arms with that person and start trying to tag other people. If they tag another person, that person joins on to the person who tagged them, and when a fourth person is tagged, that person links to the person who tagged them, and they all split in the middle. Note: you can only tag if you are on the end of a chain.</p>
