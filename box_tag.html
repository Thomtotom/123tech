        <h2>10 or more people, timer</h2>
        <p>1. Set the timer for 10 seconds<br />
        2. Define the edges of an area where people must stay inside. <br />
        3. Everyone goes inside the box and someone is randomly chosen to be in.<br />
        4. Start the timer, then the person who is in can run around and tag someone while everyone else runs away.<br />
        5. Whoever is in at the end of the 10 seconds is out.<br />
        6. Every so often, shrink the box slightly so there is just enough room for everyone still playing.<br />
